# Simple Text Editor using Python

This text editor was made following @s4vitar's online course "Python Ofensivo" on his Hack4u Academy (Hack4u.io). 


### Requirements
This was coded on Python 3.12.1 so you might have problems if your version is too old. Nothing more is needed.

## Functions
It has four functions:

- Nuevo: Clears the text area in order to write a new file.
- Abrir: Shows File Manager for the user to choose a file, and opens it in the text editor.
- Guardar: Opens the File Manager for the user to choose a directory and filename to save the content of the text area.
- Salir: Exits the Simple Text Editor.


There's another function that says "Ayuda", but that hasn't been implemented yet :)
